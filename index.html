    <p>1. Do you think there is a "right" or "ideal" set of conditions for optimal radish seed germination? Explain.<br><i>yes, because some plants don't need as much h2o or as much Sun</i><br><br>2. Do you think there are other factors, besides the 4 given factors, that affect the amount of seed germination and/ or growth rate? If so, what are they?<br><i>I think there are, b/c in san-fran, they have pretty bad air quality and there is less plants then here, where there is better air quality</i><br><br>4. What is the obvious dependent variable (DV) in this experiment?<br><i>The DV is size, obviously</i><br><br>5. List all possible independent variables (IV) in this experiment?<br></p>
    <ul>
      <li><i>seed #</i></li>
      <li><i>amnt of h2o</i></li>
    </ul>
    <p>6. Which independent variable (IV) would you like to focus on? How can you manipulate this?<br><i>water, just put less/more in & see what happens!!!</i><br><br>7. What should you do with all of the other variables (except your primary IV and DV) in your experiment?<br><i>keep them the same</i><br><br></p>

    <p><br><u><b>Plan it out...</b></u><br>    1. <u><b>QUESTION / Problem:</b></u><br><i>Does the amount of h2o affect the germination of raddish seeds</i><br><br><b><u>2. Knowledge Probe / Research:</u></b><br>What do you already know / can you learn about the subject before you begin your experiment? The research should cover these three areas:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>the subject in general<br><i>seeds need ideal placement</i></li>
      <li>the chosen primary indepndent variable<br><i>It comes from the clouds</i></li>
      <li>related research pr why this topic is important<br><i>to save the sea-turtles</i></li>
    </ul>
    <p>3. <u><b>PREDICTION / HYPOTHESIS:</b></u><br><i>If 7ml of h2o is used then 7 out 21</i><br><b><i>**This is a "testable" statement. It includes your dependent and independent variable, and it is written in an "if...then"... format)</i></b></p>
