    <p>1. Do you think there is a "right" or "ideal" set of conditions for optimal radish seed germination? Explain.<br><i>yes, because some plants don't need as much h2o or as much Sun</i><br><br>2. Do you think there are other factors, besides the 4 given factors, that affect the amount of seed germination and/ or growth rate? If so, what are they?<br><i>I think there are, b/c in san-fran, they have pretty bad air quality and there is less plants then here, where there is better air quality</i><br><br>4. What is the obvious dependent variable (DV) in this experiment?<br><i>The DV is size, obviously</i><br><br>5. List all possible independent variables (IV) in this experiment?<br></p>
    <ul>
      <li><i>seed #</i></li>
      <li><i>amnt of h2o</i></li>
    </ul>
    <p>6. Which independent variable (IV) would you like to focus on? How can you manipulate this?<br><i>water, just put less/more in & see what happens!!!</i><br><br>7. What should you do with all of the other variables (except your primary IV and DV) in your experiment?<br><i>keep them the same</i><br><br></p>
